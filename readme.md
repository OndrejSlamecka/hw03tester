This is something for university course I am taking, not interesting for anyone outside. Sorry.

Install & run
=============

Move to directory where you keep your sources (domtree.c,...) and enter commands

	$ git clone git://github.com/OndrejSlamecka/hw03tester.git
	$ cd hw03tester

and then

	$ bash run.sh -c

Parameter -c causes the script to copy source files (domtree.c,...) from the directory above.

To run again if you didn't change your source files:

	$ bash run.sh
