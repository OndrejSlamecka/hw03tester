This is something for university course I am taking, not interesting for anyone outside. Sorry.

Install
=======

Move to directory where you keep your sources (domtree.c,...) and enter commands

	$ git clone git://github.com/OndrejSlamecka/hw03tester.git

**NOTE:** It is really important that hw03tester directory is inside the directory with your source code as it copies your sources files every time it is run.

Run
===

Move to the directory with your source code and then:

	$ cd hw03tester
	$ bash run.sh
